    <h1>About This Demo</h1>
    <p>SID (short for Sound Interface Device) is the name of the sound
    chip used in the VC 10, C64 and C128.  The chip's distinctive sound is easily
    recognized and was clearly ahead the competition. The chip combines analogue
    and digital circuitry, that cannot be emulated with 100% fidelity even today.
    Emulated sounds do come very close to the original and a layperson is not likely
    to notice the difference. The SID sound is well known among retro gamers.</p>

    <p>I grew up with the C64 during the 80's, and played a lot of games on it. So I figured,
     it would be a way for me to get into and learn some React and Redux while creating this player.
     The design of the player was designed by: Drew Vosburg, and can be found here
     ( <a href="http://codepen.io/drewvosburg/pen/YyvwJY">http://codepen.io/drewvosburg/pen/YyvwJY</a> ).
     The jsSID ( JavaScript SID Emulator ) used was created by: <a href="http://hermit.sidrip.com">Mihaly Horvath</a>.</p>
     <p>The music is from one of my favorite C64 game series, "The Last Ninja", created by: <a href="http://www.system3.com">System 3</a> back in the late 1980 - 1990s.</p>
     <p>The lovely chiptunes were composed by:</p>
